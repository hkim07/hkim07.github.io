Large-scale baseball data have been utilized in decision making process by team managers. Recent studies with PITCHf/x, a system that tracks every pitch, provide new insights on the role of the pitch-type sequence in the pitcher's performance. These studies are based on the assumption that the pitch-type uncertainty puts the hitter at a disadvantage. However, the pitch-zone uncertainty, another factor of pitching uncertainty, is neglected in many cases. Here, we introduce normalized mutual information for pitch type and pitch-zone as an indicator of pitching uncertainty. A pitcher with less of a repertoire with respect to type-zone combination has high normalized mutual information in pitching. We calculate the pitch type - zone uncertainties for major league baseball starting pitchers and compare the results with field independent pitching, a metric of pitcher's performance. Our analysis shows that normalized mutual information is uncorrelated with performance in nine distinct subgroups extracted from revealed comparative advantage in pitch type. This result underlines the importance of the pitcher's repertoire and ability to be competitive in professional baseball.","tags":["Baseball","Uncertainty","Revealed Comparative Advantage"],"title":"Does pitch type-zone uncertainty matter to pitcher's performance?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyunuk Kim","Taekho You","Sang-Jin Ahn","Woo-Sung Jung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1459468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459468800,"objectID":"536dc5fd87b0f8a6e0a9f38a778f951f","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/publication/embracing-networks-national-policy-research-in-future-foresight/","publishdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/embracing-networks-national-policy-research-in-future-foresight/","section":"publication","summary":"Policy research on social issues usually has been led by the national government. Policy research reflects national interests in the present as well as in the future. In this paper, we examine a possibility to apply network analysis of national policy research in future foresight. Network analysis is conducted based on the bibliometric data retrieved from the National Knowledge Information System (NKIS) of Korea which helps public to find national research papers with ease. We classify these issues into three categories (national security, economy, and social problem), and calculated centrality measures to detect important social issues and keywords. Keywords with high betweenness centrality show detailed social trends in Korea.","tags":["Foresight","Network Analysis","Centrality"],"title":"Embracing networks of national policy research in future foresight","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyunuk Kim","Woo-Sung Jung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1458604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1458604800,"objectID":"7eab4420d80ec8d49411b8af4b31d049","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/publication/bibliometric-analysis-of-collaboration-network-and-the-role-of-research-station-in-antarctic-science/","publishdate":"2016-03-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bibliometric-analysis-of-collaboration-network-and-the-role-of-research-station-in-antarctic-science/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the large scale of Antarctic science, scientific collaboration is required for conducting scientific research. In this study, we attempted to investigate collaboration network and the role of research station in Antarctic science based on bibliometric data from 1995 to 2014. We confirmed that geographical proximity tends to be important for scientific collaboration by employing community detection in the network. This result raises the question about what the role of research station in Antarctica is. We tried to reveal its role by focusing on five countries, Belgium, China, Czech Republic, India, and Korea that constructed new research stations during the last decade. Relative growth rate, a value to measure the growth of publications, didn't differ much around the construction period compared to those in other periods for these countries except Belgium. However, we found geographical keywords emerged around the construction for all five countries. These keywords were utilized to observe national research activities in Antarctica. They show where countries started to be concerned about after the construction.","tags":["Big Science","Scientometrics","Network Analysis","Community Detection"],"title":"Bibliometric analysis of collaboration network and the role of research station in Antarctic science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyunuk Kim","Sang-Jin Ahn","Woo-Sung Jung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1446336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446336000,"objectID":"98c9b8941c275f2d6e058f20cc58deb6","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/publication/a-study-on-technology-forecasting-based-on-co-occurrence-network-of-keyword-in-multidisciplinary-journals/","publishdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-study-on-technology-forecasting-based-on-co-occurrence-network-of-keyword-in-multidisciplinary-journals/","section":"publication","summary":"Keyword indexed in multidisciplinary journals show trends about science and technology innovation. Nature and Science were selected as multidisciplinary journals for our analysis. In order to reduce the effect of plurality of keyword, stemming algorithm were implemented. After this process, we fitted growth curve of keyword (stem) following bass model, which is a well-known model in diffusion process. Bass model is useful for expressing growth pattern by assuming innovative and imitative activities in innovation spreading. In addition, we construct keyword co-occurrence network and calculate network measures such as centrality indices and local clustering coefficient. Based on network metrics and yearly frequency of keyword, time series analysis was conducted for obtaining statistical causality between these measures. For some cases, local clustering coefficient seems to Granger-cause yearly frequency of keyword. We expect that local clustering coefficient could be a supportive indicator of emerging science and technology.","tags":["Foresight","Time Series","Network Centrality"],"title":"A study on technology forecasting based on co-occurrence network of keyword in multidisciplinary journals [written in Korean]","type":"publication"}]

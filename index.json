A nuclear fusion device called the “tokamak” is a source of great interest for many countries because it ideally generates sustainable energy expected to solve the energy crisis in the future. Here, to explore the scientific effects of tokamaks, we map a country’s research capability in nuclear fusion research with normalized revealed comparative advantage on five topical clusters—material, plasma, device, diagnostics, and simulation—detected through a dynamic topic model. Our approach captures not only the growth of China, India, and the Republic of Korea but also the decline of Canada, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Time points of their rise and fall are related to tokamak operation, highlighting the importance of large facilities in big science. The gravity model points out that two countries collaborate less in device, diagnostics, and plasma research if they have comparative advantages in different topics. This relation is a unique feature of nuclear fusion compared to other science fields. Our results can be used and extended when building national policies for big science.","tags":[],"title":"Measuring national capability over big science’s multidisciplinarity: A case study of nuclear fusion research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyunuk Kim","Sang-Jin Ahn","Woo-Sung Jung"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"85bf587f170d9dcd9f7967db40a8c023","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/publication/horizon/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/horizon/","section":"publication","summary":"National governments take advantage of collective intelligence when conducting foresight processes. They grasp emerging issues through expert reviews as well as public opinions. It raises national agendas and affects policy-making process. Therefore, by examining policy papers which contain societal issues, we can perceive past, current, and future environments. In this study, we exploit policy research database of Republic of Korea, which is a unique source that automatically collects all policy papers written by national research institutes, to extract latent topics and their trends over 10 years through a probabilistic topic model. Detected topics fairly correspond to expert-selected future drivers in national foresight report, implying that public discourse and policy agenda are coupled. We suggest to utilize open government data and text mining methods for building open foresight framework that various actors exchange their opinions on societal issues.","tags":[],"title":"Horizon scanning in policy research database with a probabilistic topic model","type":"publication"}]

However, it depends on not only the quality of a paper but also various factors, such as conventionality, journal, team size, career age, and gender. Here, we examine the extent to which the conventionality of a paper is related to its citation count by using our measure, topic disparity. The topic disparity is the cosine distance between a paper and its discipline on a neural embedding space. Using this measure, we show that the topic disparity is negatively associated with citation count, even after controlling journal impact, team size, and the career age and gender of the first and last authors. This result indicates that less conventional research tends to receive fewer citations than conventional research. The topic disparity can be used to complement citation count and to recommend papers at the periphery of a discipline because of their less conventional topics.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying the topic disparity of scientific articles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyunuk Kim","Dylan Walker"],"categories":[],"content":"During a time of crisis, as with the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation can emerge rapidly on online social media platforms such as Twitter. When it does, detecting it can be a challenge because we do not know what kind of misinformation is spreading. Typical keyword-search methods are difficult to employ when you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, and also tend to return a large volume of accurate information. Finding misinformation in this large volume of posts is like finding a needle in a haystack.\nHowever, we noticed that many social media users fact check misinformation when they encounter it. These fact checks are much easier to find. While we may know little about emerging misinformation, we often do know at least one source of accurate information, which we can leverage to identify fact checks. We found that, by looking for Twitter replies that seem to echo accurate information, we could identify tweets that often contained misinformation. While the misinformation we discover with this approach has already been fact checked once, it is often not centrally known by organizations and researchers who are interested in tracking, classifying and addressing misinformation in real time. Moreover, we noticed that the timelines of friends and followers of misinformation posters tended to contain a higher proportion of misinformation posts. Our prototype is based on these observations and enables crowdsourcing fact checking by providing an interface to a team of (volunteer of professional) fact checkers to help them identify, classify, and fact check misinformation before it can be retweeted and spread further.\nPlease check our project page at the COVID-19 Global Hackathon 1.0 (https://devpost.com/software/covid-19-misinformation-monitoring-for-fact-checking).\n","date":1589846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589846400,"objectID":"e9c3e3b7d0c21c5be93f3bb704e3b3f0","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/project/factchecker/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/factchecker/","section":"project","summary":"Health misinformation can spread rapidly during a crisis, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A nuclear fusion device called the “tokamak” is a source of great interest for many countries because it ideally generates sustainable energy expected to solve the energy crisis in the future. Here, to explore the scientific effects of tokamaks, we map a country’s research capability in nuclear fusion research with normalized revealed comparative advantage on five topical clusters—material, plasma, device, diagnostics, and simulation—detected through a dynamic topic model. Our approach captures not only the growth of China, India, and the Republic of Korea but also the decline of Canada, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Time points of their rise and fall are related to tokamak operation, highlighting the importance of large facilities in big science. The gravity model points out that two countries collaborate less in device, diagnostics, and plasma research if they have comparative advantages in different topics. This relation is a unique feature of nuclear fusion compared to other science fields. Our results can be used and extended when building national policies for big science.","tags":[],"title":"Measuring national capability over big science’s multidisciplinarity: A case study of nuclear fusion research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"333d5c3a8306d466727250474401f431","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/bsi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bsi/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"page"}]

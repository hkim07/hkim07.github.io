When it does, detecting it can be a challenge because we do not know what kind of misinformation is spreading. Typical keyword-search methods are difficult to employ when you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, and also tend to return a large volume of accurate information. Finding misinformation in this large volume of posts is like finding a needle in a haystack.\nHowever, we noticed that many social media users fact check misinformation when they encounter it. These fact checks are much easier to find. While we may know little about emerging misinformation, we often do know at least one source of accurate information, which we can leverage to identify fact checks. We found that, by looking for Twitter replies that seem to echo accurate information, we could identify tweets that often contained misinformation. While the misinformation we discover with this approach has already been fact checked once, it is often not centrally known by organizations and researchers who are interested in tracking, classifying and addressing misinformation in real time. Moreover, we noticed that the timelines of friends and followers of misinformation posters tended to contain a higher proportion of misinformation posts. Our prototype is based on these observations and enables crowdsourcing fact checking by providing an interface to a team of (volunteer of professional) fact checkers to help them identify, classify, and fact check misinformation before it can be retweeted and spread further.\nPlease check our project page at the COVID-19 Global Hackathon 1.0 (https://devpost.com/software/covid-19-misinformation-monitoring-for-fact-checking).\n","date":1589846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589846400,"objectID":"e9c3e3b7d0c21c5be93f3bb704e3b3f0","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/project/factchecker/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/factchecker/","section":"project","summary":"Health misinformation can spread rapidly during a crisis, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic.

They grasp emerging issues through expert reviews as well as public opinions. It raises national agendas and affects policy-making process. Therefore, by examining policy papers which contain societal issues, we can perceive past, current, and future environments. In this study, we exploit policy research database of Republic of Korea, which is a unique source that automatically collects all policy papers written by national research institutes, to extract latent topics and their trends over 10 years through a probabilistic topic model. Detected topics fairly correspond to expert-selected future drivers in national foresight report, implying that public discourse and policy agenda are coupled. We suggest to utilize open government data and text mining methods for building open foresight framework that various actors exchange their opinions on societal issues.","tags":[],"title":"Horizon scanning in policy research database with a probabilistic topic model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyunuk Kim","Inho Hong","Woo-Sung Jung"],"categories":[],"content":"Link to the paper\n","date":1549631890,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549631890,"objectID":"a2f240ad3899b0db60b3491c58c19dfe","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/publication/fusion/","publishdate":"2019-02-08T09:18:10-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fusion/","section":"publication","summary":"In the era of big science, countries allocate big research and development budgets to large scientific facilities that boost collaboration and research capability. A nuclear fusion device called the “tokamak” is a source of great interest for many countries because it ideally generates sustainable energy expected to solve the energy crisis in the future. Here, to explore the scientific effects of tokamaks, we map a country’s research capability in nuclear fusion research with normalized revealed comparative advantage on five topical clusters—material, plasma, device, diagnostics, and simulation—detected through a dynamic topic model. Our approach captures not only the growth of China, India, and the Republic of Korea but also the decline of Canada, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Time points of their rise and fall are related to tokamak operation, highlighting the importance of large facilities in big science. The gravity model points out that two countries collaborate less in device, diagnostics, and plasma research if they have comparative advantages in different topics. This relation is a unique feature of nuclear fusion compared to other science fields. Our results can be used and extended when building national policies for big science.","tags":[],"title":"Measuring national capability over big science’s multidisciplinarity: A case study of nuclear fusion research","type":"publication"}]

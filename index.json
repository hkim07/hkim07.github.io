Their international movements facilitate the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and thus are important for research and development. To understand postdoctoral mobility at a global scale, this paper analyzes self-reported career trajectories of postdoctoral researchers by leveraging Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID), focusing on five STEM fields: Biological Sciences, Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Engineering, and Physical Sciences. The U.S. and European countries are major destinations for the first postdoctoral position across the selected fields, and three Asian countries – China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea – also attract postdoctoral researchers in Chemical Sciences and Engineering. Gender differences are observed for some specific cases mainly due to the tendency that female postdoctoral researchers are more likely to stay in a single country or less likely to move to the U.S. for the second postdoctoral position compared to male postdoctoral researchers. The results would be leveraged to design science and technology policies for postdoctoral researchers in consideration of additional factors, such as culture and language.","tags":[],"title":"Global mobility of the recent STEM postdoctoral workforce registered in ORCID","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seonbin Jo","Woo-Sung Jung","Hyunuk Kim"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1731715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1731715200,"objectID":"fbce5d30073631a1fbd34e5c40315362","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/publication/nft/","publishdate":"2024-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nft/","section":"publication","summary":"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are immutable and transferable tokens on blockchain networks, have been used to certify the ownership of digital images often grouped in collections.

Today, social media can function as an important channel to disseminate information about AMR. The way in which this information is engaged with depends on a number of factors, including the target audience and the content of the social media post. The aim of this study is to better understand how AMR-related content is consumed on the social media platform Twitter and to understand some of the drivers of engagement. This is essential to designing effective public health strategies, raising awareness about antimicrobial stewardship, and enabling academics to effectively promote their research on social media. We took advantage of unrestricted access to the metrics associated with the Twitter bot @AntibioticResis, which has over 13,900 followers. This bot posts the latest AMR research in the format of a title and a URL link to the PubMed page for an article. The tweets do not contain other attributes such as author, affiliation, or journal. Therefore, engagement with the tweets is only affected by the words used in the titles. Using negative binomial regression models, we measured the impact of pathogen names in paper titles, academic attention inferred from publication counts, and general attention estimated from Twitter on URL clicks to AMR research papers. Followers of @AntibioticResis consisted primarily of health care professionals and academic researchers whose interests comprised mainly AMR, infectious diseases, microbiology, and public health. Three World Health Organization (WHO) critical priority pathogens—Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae—were positively associated with URL clicks. Papers with shorter titles tended to have more engagements. We also described some key linguistic characteristics that should be considered when a researcher is trying to maximize engagement with their publication. Our finding suggests that specific pathogens gain more attention on Twitter than others and that the levels of attention do not necessarily correspond to their status on the WHO priority pathogen list. This suggests that more targeted public health strategies may be needed to raise awareness about AMR among specific pathogens. Analysis of follower data suggests that in the busy schedules of health care professionals, social media offers a fast and accessible gateway to staying abreast of the latest developments in this field.

Understanding the dynamics of recreational gatherings is essential to building effective public health policies but challenging as the interaction between people and recreational places is complex. Recreational activities are concentrated in a set of urban areas and establish a recreational hierarchy. In this hierarchy, higher-level regions attract more people than lower-level regions for recreational purposes. Here, using customers’ motel booking records which are highly associated with recreational activities in Korea, we identify that recreational hierarchy, geographical distance, and attachment to a location are crucial factors of recreational gatherings in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Our analyses show that after the COVID-19 outbreak, people are more likely to visit familiar recreational places, avoid the highest level of the recreational hierarchy, and travel close distances. Interestingly, the recreational visitations were reduced not only in the highest but also in low-level regions. Urban areas at low levels of the recreational hierarchy were more severely affected by COVID-19 than urban areas at high and middle levels of the recreational hierarchy.","tags":[],"title":"COVID-19 confines recreational gatherings in Seoul to familiar, less crowded, and neighboring urban areas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Wells","Irena Vodenska","Sarah Finnie Robinson","Arunima Krishna","Gianluca Stringhini","Hyunuk Kim","Michelle Amazeen"],"categories":[],"content":"Please visit the page https://www.bu.edu/ise/collaborate/faculty/focused-research-program for details.\n","date":1653868800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653868800,"objectID":"9c49b1f1c1be70dd0a316d503c5bf1d1","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/project/climatechange/","publishdate":"2022-05-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/climatechange/","section":"project","summary":"Please visit the page https://www.bu.edu/ise/collaborate/faculty/focused-research-program for details.","tags":["Misinformation","Climate Change"],"title":"Data and Misinformation in an Era of Sustainability and Climate Change Crises","type":"project"},{"authors":["Munjung Kim","Jisung Yoon","Woo-Sung Jung","Hyunuk Kim"],"categories":[],"content":"Link to the paper\n","date":1650931200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650931200,"objectID":"e82f8c6bee2bd1a9abba25ae0a5d6ed8","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/publication/topic_disparity/","publishdate":"2022-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/topic_disparity/","section":"publication","summary":"Citation count is a popular index for assessing scientific papers. However, it depends on not only the quality of a paper but also various factors, such as conventionality, journal, team size, career age, and gender. Here, we examine the extent to which the conventionality of a paper is related to its citation count by using our measure, topic disparity. The topic disparity is the cosine distance between a paper and its discipline on a neural embedding space. Using this measure, we show that the topic disparity is negatively associated with citation count, even after controlling journal impact, team size, and the career age and gender of the first and last authors. This result indicates that less conventional research tends to receive fewer citations than conventional research. The topic disparity can be used to complement citation count and to recommend papers at the periphery of a discipline because of their less conventional topics.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying the topic disparity of scientific articles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyunuk Kim","Dylan Walker"],"categories":[],"content":"During a time of crisis, as with the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation can emerge rapidly on online social media platforms such as Twitter. When it does, detecting it can be a challenge because we do not know what kind of misinformation is spreading. Typical keyword-search methods are difficult to employ when you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, and also tend to return a large volume of accurate information. Finding misinformation in this large volume of posts is like finding a needle in a haystack.\nHowever, we noticed that many social media users fact check misinformation when they encounter it. These fact checks are much easier to find. While we may know little about emerging misinformation, we often do know at least one source of accurate information, which we can leverage to identify fact checks. We found that, by looking for Twitter replies that seem to echo accurate information, we could identify tweets that often contained misinformation. While the misinformation we discover with this approach has already been fact checked once, it is often not centrally known by organizations and researchers who are interested in tracking, classifying and addressing misinformation in real time. Moreover, we noticed that the timelines of friends and followers of misinformation posters tended to contain a higher proportion of misinformation posts. Our prototype is based on these observations and enables crowdsourcing fact checking by providing an interface to a team of (volunteer of professional) fact checkers to help them identify, classify, and fact check misinformation before it can be retweeted and spread further.\nPlease check our project page at the COVID-19 Global Hackathon 1.0 (https://devpost.com/software/covid-19-misinformation-monitoring-for-fact-checking).\n","date":1589846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589846400,"objectID":"e9c3e3b7d0c21c5be93f3bb704e3b3f0","permalink":"https://hkim07.github.io/project/factchecker/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/factchecker/","section":"project","summary":"Health misinformation can spread rapidly during a crisis, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, to explore the scientific effects of tokamaks, we map a country’s research capability in nuclear fusion research with normalized revealed comparative advantage on five topical clusters—material, plasma, device, diagnostics, and simulation—detected through a dynamic topic model. Our approach captures not only the growth of China, India, and the Republic of Korea but also the decline of Canada, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Time points of their rise and fall are related to tokamak operation, highlighting the importance of large facilities in big science. The gravity model points out that two countries collaborate less in device, diagnostics, and plasma research if they have comparative advantages in different topics.
